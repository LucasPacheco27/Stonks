# Stonks 
A UI/UX Stock App Project

# üìà Project Overview
Stonks is a personal project and a UI/UX case study focused on making financial tracking and education accessible and engaging for a younger demographic. The mobile app's design aims to demystify investing and personal finance through a clean, intuitive interface, departing from the intimidating design of traditional financial applications.

# üéØ The UI/UX Challenge

* Traditional financial applications are often overwhelming and visually complex, creating a barrier to entry for new and young investors. The challenge was to design a platform that:
* Simplifies Complex Data: Transforms confusing financial data into easy-to-understand visuals and actionable insights, optimized for a mobile screen.
* Encourages Engagement: Uses a clean, approachable design and clear user flows to keep users motivated.
* Builds Trust: Presents information in a clean, transparent, and approachable manner.
* Stonks addresses these challenges by prioritizing user experience and designing for clarity, accessibility, and ease of use.

# ‚ú® Key Features

* Intuitive Interface: A clean, single-view user interface to track portfolio performance at a glance.
* Simplified Data Visualization: Interactive, simplified charts that highlight key trends without the clutter.
* Portfolio Management: Tools for tracking individual stocks and overall portfolio health.

# üöÄ The UI/UX Design Process
My design process was driven by a deep understanding of the target audience, following these key steps:

1. Research & Discovery

* Competitive Analysis: Analyzed existing financial apps to identify common pain points and design opportunities.
* User Interviews: Conducted interviews with college students and recent graduates to understand their attitudes toward money and investing.

2. Wireframing & Prototyping

* Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Created initial sketches and wireframes to outline the app's information architecture and user flows.
* High-Fidelity Prototypes: Developed an interactive prototype in Figma, adding a vibrant visual style and interactive components to simulate the user experience.

3. Usability Testing
* Remote Testing: Conducted unmoderated tests to observe how users interacted with the data visualizations and app navigation.
* Design Iteration: Based on user feedback, I refined the interface layout and simplified the onboarding process to reduce friction.

4. Visual Design
* Aesthetic: Adopted a vibrant, modern, and friendly aesthetic with bold colors and rounded corners to contrast with traditional financial app designs.
* Typography: Selected a bold, legible font to ensure clarity for all data points and labels.
